# Basic Models in PyTorch

This repository contains implementations of some fundamental deep learning models using PyTorch. These models serve as a starting point for understanding the core concepts of neural networks and their applications.

## Contents
- **Basics**: Providing an overview of fundamental operations in PyTorch
- **Linear Regression**: A simple linear model to predict continuous values.
- **Logistic Regression**: A binary classification model.
- **Feedforward Neural Network**: A multi-layer perceptron for different tasks.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A basic CNN for image classification.
- **Computer Vision Models**: Implementation of various CNN architectures, including ResNet, VGG, MobileNet, and EfficientNet.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: A simple RNN for sequence data.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: An LSTM model for sequence prediction.
- **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: A basic GAN for generating synthetic data.
