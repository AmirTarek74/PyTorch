# Image Captioning with CNN-RNN Model

This repository contains code for implementing an image captioning model using a CNN-RNN architecture. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features from an image, which are then passed to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate descriptive captions. This approach is useful for generating natural language descriptions of images and has applications in accessibility tools, image tagging, and visual content understanding.

## Overview

This project aims to generate captions for images using a deep learning approach, specifically a CNN-RNN pipeline. The model leverages the power of CNNs for feature extraction and RNNs for sequential data processing. The project is divided into the following stages:

1. **Feature Extraction** - Using a pre-trained CNN model to extract high-level visual features from images.
2. **Caption Generation** - Using an RNN (LSTM) to interpret these features and generate meaningful captions.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [(Flickr8k Images Captions)]([https://cocodataset.org/#home](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/e1cd22253a9b23b073794872bf565648ddbe4f17e7fa9e74766ad3707141adeb)) dataset, which provides images along with captions. You can download the dataset and use it for training.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of two main components:

1. **CNN Encoder:** The encoder uses a pre-trained CNN ( ResNet) to extract feature vectors from each image. These vectors represent the high-level features of the images.
   
2. **RNN Decoder:** The decoder is an RNN (LSTM) that takes the feature vector from the encoder and generates captions word-by-word. The decoder is trained to predict the next word in a sentence given the current word and the image features.

The model combines these components as a single architecture with a CNN-to-RNN pipeline.
